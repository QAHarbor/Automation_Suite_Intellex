# Intellex-Automation-Project_playwright
## Project Overview
#This web application enables mentorship, allowing mentors and mentees to manage profiles, schedule sessions, and handle payments. Mentors sign up with personal details, industry, and bank info (for paid mentors), while mentees provide personal information and skill interests. Authentication is handled via email/password or Google SSO. The system integrates Cal.com for scheduling, Stripe for payments and escrow, and Daily.co for video conferencing. Mentors can manage availability and track payments, while mentees can search mentors, track sessions, and view payment history. Admins can manage users, oversee bookings and payments, and access analytics. Notifications and reminders are automated using MailGun for confirmation emails and session reminders. The technology stack includes Next.js, Node.js, MongoDB, Stripe, Daily.co, and MailGun for seamless operation and integration.
